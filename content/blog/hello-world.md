**Welcome to my blog — and thanks for stopping by!**

{% paragraph(class="m-8") %}
This is my very first post, and I thought a simple "Hello World" would be a fitting way to kick things off. I'm Tanveer, a Full Stack Developer and self-taught SysAdmin. I spend most of my time building web applications with **Laravel**, and managing the systems that host them using tools like **NGINX** as webserver, **Docker** for containers.
{% end %}

{% paragraph(class="m-8") %}
Through this blog, I plan to share my experiences, insights, and the occasional troubleshooting war story from both development and server-side adventures. Whether it's code patterns, deployment pipelines, or server optimizations, you'll find it here.
{% end %}

{% paragraph(class="m-8") %}
This blog isn't just a showcase — it's a reflection of my journey. I'm a strong believer in learning by doing, and everything I know has been shaped by building, breaking, and fixing things on my own.
{% end %}

{% paragraph(class="m-8") %}
Expect more posts soon on Laravel internals, secure deployments, performance tuning, and anything else I stumble upon or dive into.
{% end %}

{% paragraph(class="m-8") %}
**Thanks again for reading. More to come :rocket:**
