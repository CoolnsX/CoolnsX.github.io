When I was a kid, we had cable TV,which included a channel called **Animax**. I watched only one anime on that channel called {{ link(text="Fairy Tail.",href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail") }} I loved it so much that I generally kept myself free when it was airing But we soon switched to DTH television. The problem is that **Animax** was a paid channel in its subscription. So, I stopped watching it.

Fast Forward to a few years, we siblings got a shared smartphone. So we got an Idea to start watching {{ link(text="Fairy Tail",href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail") }} again. We started going to a cafe where the owner charged very little money for a half-hour session and we started downloading the whole series. This was done in many visits everyday as the speed was not that good. We watched them side by side so that we could delete them and make space for the next episodes. We completed it that way.

Then the neighbour's Wi-Fi happened, and I started watching other anime. This was during my time in high school, and I somewhat messed up my studies due to watching too much anime. And this led to getting admission to an average College after high school.

The issue I have is that I don't judge anime; I just do it sarcastically without meaning it. I watch anime for enjoyment, not to critique it. Life is too short for judgmentâ€”I'd rather enjoy what I watch and move on.
