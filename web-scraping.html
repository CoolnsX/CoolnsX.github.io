    <p>Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. </p>

These include using online services, particular APIâ€™s or even creating your code for web scraping from scratch.
